  We engage in public outreach activities aimed at popularising cloud physics and
    addressing gaps in the availability of academic materials in both Polish and English,
    including books, Wikipedia articles and coding tutorials.

### Polish edition of the Rogers & Yau "<em>Short course on cloud physics</em>"

Our flagship outreach project! 
<a href="https://wuj.pl/ksiazka/zarys-fizyki-chmur">Published in 2023 and available in bookstores and online (as both an e-book and a hard copy)</a>.
The first and, so far, the only book devoted exclusively to cloud physics published in the Polish language. 

Kudos to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafal-korycinski-15116027/">Rafał Koryciński</a>
  for his excellent work translating the book into Polish,
  to <a href="https://matuszko.wordpress.com/">Dorota Matuszko</a> 
  for her editorial guidance and for connecting us with <a href="https://wuj.pl/">Jagiellonian University Press</a>,
  which handled all legal, practical and technical matters superbly, and to
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-jaszczuk-8594b0178/">Marta Jaszczuk</a> for the sleek cover design, which we greatly appreciate.
The entire book was typeset in
