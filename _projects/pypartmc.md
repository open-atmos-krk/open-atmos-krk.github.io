description: |
  PyPartMC is a Python interface to <a href="https://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc/">PartMC</a>, 
    a particle-resolved Monte-Carlo code for atmospheric aerosol simulation. 
  PyPartMC is implemented in C++ and it also constitutes a C++ API to the PartMC Fortran internals.
  The Python API facilitates using PartMC from other environments, including Julia and Matlab.
