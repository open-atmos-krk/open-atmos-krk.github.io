<p>
We host the <b>particle-based-cloud-modelling@mail.agh.edu.pl</b> mailing list. 
As of time of writing, we have over 80 subscribers from 12 countries - a community focused on cloud and aerosol modelling using Lagrangian methods.
The list is a venue for communications relevant to the development and applications of&nbsp;particle-based models 
  of atmospheric clouds: announcements of meetings, calls for submissions, funding opportunities, scholarships, openings, 
  software/data releases, publications and other notices warranting community-wide dissemination.
